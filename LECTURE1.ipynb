This can be seen from its series expansion, as the series does not terminate nor does it repeat in any discernible pattern, which are characteristics of rational numbers. A more formal proof involves the fact that if \\( e \\) were rational, then there would exist integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (with \\( b > 0 \\)) such that \\( e = \\frac{a}{b} \\). By manipulating the series and estimating the error of truncating after a finite number of terms, one can show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, thus proving \\( e \\) is irrational.\n",
